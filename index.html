		<div class="point-wrapper">
			<h2> Self Taught </h2>
			<p> I have taught myself the fundamentals of front end web development using a mixture of online courses and consulting with others on forums such as stack overflow. I believe this demonstrates that I have both the passion and drive to continue to improve my knowledge of technologies as well as learn new ones as they release.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="point-wrapper">
			<h2> Fast Learner </h2>
			<p>This trait has benefitted me greatly when taking in the vast amount of information that comes with learning web development. I am able to understand concepts quickly and put them into practice. A career in web development means I would always be learning, and I feel being a quick learner is incredibly benefitial. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="point-wrapper">
			<h2> Team Player </h2>
			<p>My time at university developed valuable team working skills that continue to benefit me in my working life. My ability to overcome roadblocks in my learning has been aided with my ability to communicate with others on forums. I feel as though my excellent communication skills would translate incredibly well into a collaborative enviroment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="point-wrapper">
			<h2> Latest Tech</h2>
			<p>When learning core technologies and libraries, I try my very best to ensure I am using the latest methedologies brought along by the latest versions of web development technologies. I am currently looking into ways to optimise my work flow such as more effective uses for CSS variables and writing less Javascript to achieve the same results. </p>

		<h1 id="ben-about-header"> A bit more about me</h1>
		<p id="about-me-text"> I'm a recent history graduate from the University of Worcester, although my degree is not in computer science I have developed a passion for technology and web development during university. I am incredibly driven and have been teaching myself front end web development. Now I'm looking for an employer that will support my continued growth in a commercial enviroment, in return I will bring genuine enthusiasm and the ability to learn and adapt to quickly become a valuable member of a development team.</p>

				<h3 class="skill-heading">HTML</h3>
				<p>I am able to effectively create structured layouts for my websites using the semantic elements added by HTML5. I am still learning the best practices in this regard and I am aiming to ensure my pages are as accessible as possible.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skill-item">
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg/1200px-CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png">
				<h3 class="skill-heading">CSS</h3>
				<p>I have a solid understanding of how to style and manipulate content using CSS. I am continuing to develop my skills with flexbox and CSS grid to create responsive layouts. I am currently learning how CSS variables work and will integrate them into my future work flow.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skill-item">
				<img src="https://png.icons8.com/color/1600/bootstrap.png">
				<h3 class="skill-heading">Bootstrap</h3>
				<p>I understand how the Bootstrap library works, although I prefer vanilla CSS I see the merit in the library and I find Bootstrap to be highly useful when styling Javascript applications. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="skill-item">
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Javascript-shield.png">
				<h3 class="skill-heading">Javascript</h3>
				<p>I have grasped the fundamental concepts of Javascript such as Functions, arrays, DOM manipulation and loops. I am able to store useful data and I aim to keep my code as dry as possible.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skill-item last">
				<img src="http://pluspng.com/img-png/jquery-logo-png--800.gif">
				<h3 class="skill-heading">jQuery</h3>
				<p>Although I am only beggining to learn jQuery's capabilities, I can already see how powerful of a tool it can be. (The smooth scroll on this page is done with jQuery). I am hoping to continually develop my understanding of jQuery's capabilities in order to effectively make use of the library.</p>

			<a class = "project-heading" href="#">Pigeon marketplace</a>
			<p>This page is built using a mixture of CSS grid and flexbox. I aimed to use semantic HTML. As I learn more technology
